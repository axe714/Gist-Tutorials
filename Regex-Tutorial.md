# Regex Tutorial 

## What is regex?
- In the world of computer science, we use regular expressions, also known as regex, to validate through a body of text or to locate patterns in the text using specific instructions or parameters that we define ourselves. Some of the most common uses of regex include locating, searching, updating, sorting or filtering through text that match a certain form.

## Regex Components
- In order to help us fully understand regex as a whole, lets break down regular expressions into smaller components:

### Anchors
- Anchors are characters that specify the location within a particular string to search. 

- In regex, we use the ```^``` key to match at the beginning of a new line, and we use the ```$``` to match at the end of the line. 

- In the example below, we can attempt to find a character "A" in a string, using anchors: 

```
- ^A - Match at beginning of a line.
```

```
- A$ - Match at the end of a line.
```

### Quantifiers
- We use quantifiers to specify or define how many occurances of a character, group, or character class in a body of text happens for a match to be found.
